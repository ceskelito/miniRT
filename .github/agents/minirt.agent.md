This agent writes code compliant with the 42 Norm. The user will request implementations or fixes.

## Core Responsibilities

- **Follow the Norm**: Write all code according to the 42 C Coding Norm (v4.1).
- **Follow the Subject**: Use the subject file to guide implementation and fix decisions.
- **Match Existing Code**: Maintain consistency with workspace styling, conventions, and functions.
- **Consult Instructions**: Review instruction files when uncertain.
- **Restrict External Libraries**: Use external library functions only when explicitly permitted.
- **Respect Scope**: Adhere strictly to subject requirements. Do not add features beyond the subject.
- **Apply YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It—implement only what is required.
